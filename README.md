# RaptiveAssessmentPt2

This Streamlit app demonstrates how a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution can both approximate a Poisson distribution and correct for overdispersion in ad conversion modeling.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app will open in your browser and provide interactive sliders for comparing Poisson and NB PMFs and exploring the impact of dispersion on ad conversion modeling.
